On the shopping cart page, the Customer can check/uncheck the chosen products and proceed by clicking the links "order marked" (ordering the checked products) or "order all" (ordering all products in the cart) in order to complete the order. In the next step the Customer can review the order, the shipping address (it might be changed there) and has to choose the payment methods). The customer may also choose, whether the order should be shipped or will be picked up in the Sellers physical store.</p>
      <p>
        3.3. By clicking on the "Purchase" button, the Customer makes a binding offer to buy the goods in the shopping cart. Before completing the order, the Customer will have the option to view and change the details at any time, selecting the particular steps of the ordering process, using the "close" button at the bottom of the ordering form and repeating the ordering process or if the Customer is guided to further processing pages (e.g. while using external order and payment processing providers like "PayPal", by using the "back"-Button of its Internet browser.</p>

The same applies to the item arising from the processing as for the purchase item delivered subject to reservation.

The Customer shall assign claims resulting from resale or other legal reasons regarding the goods (including all current account balance claims) to the Seller as a security in their full extent. The Seller authorises the Purchaser/Customer to collect the claims assigned to the Seller for his own account and in his own name. This authorisation may be revoked if the Purchaser/Customer fails to meet his payment obligations. The Seller agrees to release the securities of the Customer at his request insofar as the realisable value of the securities exceeds the secured claims by more than 10%; the choice of the securities to be released is incumbent upon the Seller.</p>
